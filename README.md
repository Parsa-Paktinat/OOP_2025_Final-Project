This is the final project for the Object-Oriented Programming course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology (Spring and Summer 2025).

**Creators:** Parsa Paktinat, Mohammad Parsa Dini

ParsaSpice is a simple circuit simulator, inspired by LTspice, developed using C++20, the Qt6 framework and eigen-3.4.0 for solving the MNA matrices. It provides the essential features of a modern circuit simulator, including a graphical schematic editor, basic transient and AC analysis, and project management capabilities.

## üåü Features

* **Graphical Schematic Editor:**
    * **Component Library:** Place common components like Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, Diodes, and independent Voltage/Current sources (DC or Sinusoidal).
    * **Wiring & Connectivity:** Draw wires between nodes, place grounds, and add node labels for clarity and complex connections.
    * **Schematic Editing:** Easily delete components and rotate them during placement (`Ctrl+R`).

* **Circuit Analysis:**
    * **Transient Analysis:** Simulate the circuit's behavior over time.
    * **AC Sweep Analysis:** Analyze the circuit's frequency response.

* **Interactive Plotting:**
    * **Dynamic Waveform Viewer:** View simulation results on an interactive chart with zooming and point-value inspection.
    * **Plot Customization:** Change the color and name of plotted signals directly from the chart's context menu.

* **Project Management:**
    * **Save & Open:** Save your schematics into a custom `.psp` project file and open them later to continue your work.
    * **Persistent Subcircuit Library:** Create subcircuits from existing schematics. These are saved permanently and can be reused across all your projects.
